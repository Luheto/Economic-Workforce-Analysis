Workforce Diversity
- Between 2014–2018, the NSW public sector decreased in size mainly due to a drop in male employees, while female headcount increased.
- Part-time employment grew from 26.6% to 29.5% overall.
- By 2025, part-time employment is projected to reach 34.7% across the sector.
- Female employees remain the majority (64.8% in 2018).

## Methods
Data Analysis: Employment and demographic data were analyzed across clusters (e.g., Education, Health, Finance).
Trend Analysis: Used historical data (2014–2018) to identify growth/decline.
Projection Models: Forecasting part-time representation up to 2025.
